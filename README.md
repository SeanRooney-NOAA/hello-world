An initial project
I am a NOAA Fisheries Biologist at the Alaska Fishereies Science Center RACE Division. My work is largly based on conducting quantitative fishery surveys and related ecological and oceanographic research to measure and describe the distribution and abundance of commercially important fish and crab stocks in the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska and to investigate ways to reduce bycatch, bycatch mortality and the effects of fishing on habitat.
